# Systematic Review Screening with LLM Agents

This project automates systematic literature reviews using a pipeline of intelligent agents. It uses powerful LLM-based tools to search, screen, and review academic papers based on user-defined criteria.

---

## üîç Overview

The pipeline processes user input (title, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and minimum year) and automatically retrieves and filters papers from arXiv and Semantic Scholar. It performs:

- **Search** using query terms
- **Time filtering**
- **Title & abstract screening** using DeepSeek
- **Quality assessment** of selected papers
- **Review summarization**

All of this is done through a seamless agent-based workflow, producing selected papers, scores, and a summarized review.
