Unlocking the Potential of Saliva-Based Test to Detect HPV-16-Driven Oropharyngeal Cancer.,"The incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) is rising in high-income countries, including Australia. Increasing evidence suggests that accurate HPV testing is pivotal for clinical decision making and treatment planning in these patients. Recently, the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control (AJCC/UICC) tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system for OPC (based on the p16INK4a (p16) status) was proposed and has been implemented. However, the applicability of this new staging system is still far from clear. In our study, n = 127 OPC patients from Queensland, Australia were recruited, and the tumor p16 expression in these patients was examined using immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. HPV-16 genotyping, viral load, and physical status (episomal versus integrated) in the saliva samples of OPC patients were determined using the qPCR method. A good inter-rater agreement (k = 0.612) was found between tumor p16 expression and oral HPV-16 infection in OPC. Importantly, according to the eighth edition staging system, HPV-16 DNA viral load (>10 copies/50 ng) was significantly associated with the advanced stages of OPC. In concordance with previous studies, a mixed HPV-16 form (partially or fully integrated) was predominately found in OPC patients. Taken together, our data support HPV-16 detection in saliva as a screening biomarker to identify people within the community who are at risk of developing OPC.",1,1
The role of transoral robotic surgery in the management of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma: a current review.,"The incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is increasing in the USA despite a decline in traditional risk factors. This trend is attributed to human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated malignancies and is particularly notable in a younger patient demographic with fewer comorbid diseases and longer life expectancies. Therefore, both oncologic and functional outcomes are important to consider when managing OPSCC in the modern era. The historical management of OPSCC was typically surgical, but traditional open approaches resulted in significant morbidity. As the paradigm shifted, organ-preserving treatment regimens, namely, radiotherapy (RT) and chemoradiation (CRT), replaced surgery as the primary treatment modality. However, these treatment strategies are not without risk of significant sequelae and functional impairment. Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) is a minimally invasive surgical approach that offers surgical access to the oropharynx without the morbidity of open procedures while achieving excellent oncologic and functional outcomes. The appropriate application of this new technology is still being investigated but the current literature supports TORS as a viable option in the management of OPSCC. ",0,0
Alcohol and Tobacco Increases Risk of High Risk HPV Infection in Head and Neck Cancer Patients: Study from North-East Region of India.,"Human papilloma virus (HPV) associated Head and Neck Cancers (HNCs) have generated significant amount of research interest in recent times. Due to high incidence of HNCs and lack of sufficient data on high-risk HPV (hr-HPV) infection from North -East region of India, this study was conceived to investigate hr-HPV infection, its types and its association with life style habits such as tobacco, alcohol consumption etc. A total of one hundred and six primary HNC tumor biopsy specimens were collected. These samples were analyzed for hr-HPV DNA (13 HPV types) using hybrid capture 2 (HC2) assay and genotyping was done by E6 nested multiplex PCR (NMPCR). The presence of hr-HPV was confirmed in 31.13% (n = 33) and 24.52% (n = 26) of the HNC patients by nested multiplex PCR (NMPCR) and HC2 assay respectively. Among hr-HPV positive cases, out of thirteen hr- HPV types analyzed, only two prevalent genotypes, HPV-16 (81.81%) followed by HPV-18 (18.18%) were found. Significant association was observed between hr-HPV infection with alcohol consumption (p <0.001) and tobacco chewing (p = 0.02) in HNC cases. Compared to HPV-18 infection the HPV-16 was found to be significantly associated with tobacco chewing (p = 0.02) habit. Our study demonstrated that tobacco chewing and alcohol consumption may act as risk factors for hr-HPV infection in HNCs from the North-East region of India. This was the first study from North-East India which also assessed the clinical applicability of HC2 assay in HNC patient specimens. We suggest that alcohol, tobacco and hr- HPV infection act synergistically or complement each other in the process of HNC development and progression in the present study population.",1,1
Worldwide trends in incidence rates for oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been identified as the cause of the increasing oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) incidence in some countries. To investigate whether this represents a global phenomenon, we evaluated incidence trends for OPCs and oral cavity cancers (OCCs) in 23 countries across four continents. We used data from the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents database Volumes VI to IX (years 1983 to 2002). Using age-period-cohort modeling, incidence trends for OPCs were compared with those of OCCs and lung cancers to delineate the potential role of HPV vis-Ã -vis smoking on incidence trends. Analyses were country specific and sex specific. OPC incidence significantly increased during 1983 to 2002 predominantly in economically developed countries. Among men, OPC incidence significantly increased in the United States, Australia, Canada, Japan, and Slovakia, despite nonsignificant or significantly decreasing incidence of OCCs. In contrast, among women, in all countries with increasing OPC incidence (Denmark, Estonia, France, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Switzerland, and United Kingdom), there was a concomitant increase in incidence of OCCs. Although increasing OPC incidence among men was accompanied by decreasing lung cancer incidence, increasing incidence among women was generally accompanied by increasing lung cancer incidence. The magnitude of increase in OPC incidence among men was significantly higher at younger ages (< 60 years) than older ages in the United States, Australia, Canada, Slovakia, Denmark, and United Kingdom. OPC incidence significantly increased during 1983 to 2002 predominantly in developed countries and at younger ages. These results underscore a potential role for HPV infection on increasing OPC incidence, particularly among men.",0,0
"Prophylactic HPV vaccination: past, present, and future.","Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the necessary cause of cervical cancer, the fourth most common cancer and cause of cancer-related death in females worldwide. HPV also causes anal, vaginal, vulvar, penile, and oropharyngeal cancer. Prophylactic HPV vaccines based on recombinantly expressed virus-like particles have been developed. Two first-generation, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccines prevent infections and disease caused by HPV16 and HPV18, the two HPV genotypes that cause approximately 70% of cervical cancer, and one of these vaccines also prevents HPV6 and HPV11, the two HPV genotypes that cause 90% of genital warts. A next-generation vaccine, recently approved by the U.S. FDA, targets HPV16, HPV18, and five additional HPV genotypes that together causes approximately 90% of cervical cancer as well as HPV6 and HPV11. In clinical trials, these vaccines have shown high levels of efficacy against disease and infections caused by the targeted HPV genotypes in adolescent females and males and older females. Data indicate population effectiveness, and therefore cost effectiveness, is highest in HPV-naive young females prior to becoming sexually active. Countries that implemented HPV vaccination before 2010 have already experienced decreases in population prevalence of targeted HPV genotypes and related anogenital diseases in women and via herd protection in heterosexual men. Importantly, after more than 100 million doses given worldwide, HPV vaccination has demonstrated an excellent safety profile. With demonstrated efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and safety, universal HPV vaccination of all young, adolescent women, and with available resources at least high-risk groups of men, should be a global health priority. Failure to do so will result in millions of women dying from avertable cervical cancers, especially in low- and middle-income countries, and many thousands of women and men dying from other HPV-related cancers.
